**English-Spanish Cognate Detection**

This project is a script to automatically detect cognates in a parallel corpus.

The source data is from the UN Parallel Corpus via huggingface

There are four bash scripts and one python script.

The results of the experiment are contained in the .tsv files attempt1, attempt2, and attempt3.

The runtime for proc_file.sh is ridiculously slow.
